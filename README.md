# E-Pets and care
# Final Year Project

The main purpose was to give a framework where users can buy pets and things related to pets 
online. Physical or manual purchases are a waste of time as well as expensive due to travel 
expenses. Traveling due to traffic accidents is also a dangerous job. People use public or private 
transport when they go shopping, which can lead to traffic jams. Complete purchases become 
expensive and time-consuming. This system is designed to convert manual purchasing with a 
proficient and successful online purchasing system. This system will be helpful to the users and 
will keep their information secure. There is no need to go anywhere using any kind of transport 
to buy pets and related things. Users can buy pets and things anywhere with access to the 
Internet.

# The functional scope of the system has the following main features.
 Security Management 
 Category Management
 Pet Management
 Food Management
 Stock Management
 Sale Purchase Management
 Medicine Management
 Pet Supplier Management
 Customer Management
